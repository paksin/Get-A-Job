# Get A Job!

Deployed URL: https://getajob.herokuapp.com/

## Description

Get a Job is all about networking and creating opportunities for new employees and or unemployeed people looking for a place to start. It allows users to create, and delete posts either looking for a job or reviewing a existing post. This will show future employees what to expect and provide a place to find hiring opportunities. Our motivation was to build something functional and easy for people of any tech background.
